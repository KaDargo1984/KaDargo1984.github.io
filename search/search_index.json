This means if you are going to use, modify or contribute to the OSSM project you need to be aware of the risks and potential hazards. After all, an OSSM is poking around in some very intimate and soft places. There are moving belts and motors that have a surprising amount of force all of which can hurt people. Our analysis identifies three areas of hazard; design, build and use which neatly map to groups of people. You may be a member of all three groups or only one, but most people are builders and users. Designers who contribute to the OSSM project or create their own modifications. As a designer you have a role to ensure what you design is safe. This may be a part, code or a pattern. You should also provide guidance to builders and if required users on both hazards and ways to manage them. We recommened you download and review the hazard analysis spreadsheet for more details. Builders are the people that take an OSSM from an idea into a physical reality from components, printed parts and then assemble it into a working machine. As a builder you need to ensure that what you build is strong enough to for use and keep the user safe with the designed controls. Users fall into two subgroups and you can be both at once. Operators and the receptive user who is having all the fun. Good design and a quality build can provide some protection. But keep in mind, a misused OSSM can create hazards that cannot be mitigated by design. Guidance for designers Think about any new hazards that your design may introduce. Some ideas cannot be made safe, but other risks can be managed with careful thought. Inclusive design is often safer design. Designing for people that are visually, physically or cognitively impaired is hard but there are many benefits. FDM/3D printed materials have some qualities you need to be aware of. Layer orientation, material choice all can have a positive (or negative) impact on safety. For safety critical cases be aware of the limitations of software. Programming for safety is harder than it looks and there is a considerable body of knowledge devoted to it. If you can find an alternate hazard mitigation such as a power switch that will be more reliable than a software interrupt. Don\u2019t expect users and builders to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. A designer is often best placed to understand the potential issues. A builder may not identify risks and users are often distracted when using an OSSM. Guidance for builders Get to know your 3D printer and filament. For critical parts print with thicker walls, larger layer heights and hotter temperatures than normal to maximize strength.

Both are permanent magnet electric motors but steppers are designed for high-precision, low-speed use cases that require strong holding torque. A stepper motor's initial torque is much higher than a servo but drops off significantly as speed increases. A servo will have a much lower continuous torque but will maintain that torque throughout its speed range. Servos are also necessarily closed loop, meaning they will continue to provide torque when stopped and can react to changes in resistance. An open-loop stepper can lose steps and on a system such as the OSSM, this WILL cause a crash.

It has the same mounting pattern and shaft diameter as the old motor (iHSV57-30-XX). It is sold by Research and Desire as Gold Motor or available generically as 57AIM30 If you wish to order a 57AIM30, you should source a model that runs at 1500 RPM and has an RS485 interface (NOT the 3000 RPM or CANBUS versions) Also note that if you source your motor from somewhere other than R&D, you will need to reprogram the stored settings with a USB to RS485 dongle using the scripts found here before you can use it. Advantages: Cheaper (20%) - dependant on availability and location. Smaller (40% length of 180W standard - i.e. 60% reduction!). Lighter (50% weight of 180W). Higher peak force (30% higher in real-world test). Better over-torque handling - can be configured to reduce torque output instead of disable like current 180w servo. Is drop-in replacement for iHSV57 series making BOM compatible. Requirements: - Requires V2.2 PCB or newer for simple wiring with PH-4 cable - Older boards will need wires soldered to 10 pin header - Recommend adding 1500uF capacitor, min 50V to older boards <V2.3 Disanvantages: More efficient (this causes more regenerated power in some motion conditions which requires additional capacitance and handling on the PCB). PCB v2.3 as currently sold by R&D or listed on this repo has added capacitor. If you are upgrading your motor, you should add the capacitor as shown below. Digital comms over RS485 (Not worse than current RS232, just current boards don't have the needed adapter). Requires software setup to see full benefits (default FW settings disable motor in over-torque condition). If modding your software, technically lower top speed than HSV. (Standard code speed limit is lower than gold motor limit, so not a disadvantage for regular user). 42AIM30 - Gold Motor 42 (variant) In addition to 57AIM30 (Gold Motor), which fits exactly to the previous designs and specs with no extra work, there is a varient motor which has exactly same internals and specs. The 42AIM30 (see notes above for ordering the correct model) does away with the heatsink housing and is purely the cylindrical motor with connectors at the base. Advantages (compared to 57AIM30): Smaller diameter (26%) - plus cylinder vs square. Lighter (unknown - ~25%?) - please submit mass if you have one. Disadvantages (compared to 57AIM30): Much harder to mount. No mounting ears to bolt through, must put exact length machine screws into face of motor. Current standard housings are not compatible with 42AIM30, though there are some options available via discord. Suspected heat issues caused by lack of heat sink and enclosure in printed housing - more data needed. Lack of clear advantages over Gold Motor (57AIM30) Same specs. Same length. Same disadvantages.

It has the same mounting pattern and shaft diameter as the old motor (iHSV57-30-XX). It is sold by Research and Desire as Gold Motor or available generically as 57AIM30 If you wish to order a 57AIM30, you should source a model that runs at 1500 RPM and has an RS485 interface (NOT the 3000 RPM or CANBUS versions) Also note that if you source your motor from somewhere other than R&D, you will need to reprogram the stored settings with a USB to RS485 dongle using the scripts found here before you can use it. Advantages: Cheaper (20%) - dependant on availability and location. Smaller (40% length of 180W standard - i.e. 60% reduction!). Lighter (50% weight of 180W). Higher peak force (30% higher in real-world test). Better over-torque handling - can be configured to reduce torque output instead of disable like current 180w servo. Is drop-in replacement for iHSV57 series making BOM compatible. Requirements: - Requires V2.2 PCB or newer for simple wiring with PH-4 cable - Older boards will need wires soldered to 10 pin header - Recommend adding 1500uF capacitor, min 50V to older boards <V2.3 Disanvantages: More efficient (this causes more regenerated power in some motion conditions which requires additional capacitance and handling on the PCB). PCB v2.3 as currently sold by R&D or listed on this repo has added capacitor. If you are upgrading your motor, you should add the capacitor as shown below. Digital comms over RS485 (Not worse than current RS232, just current boards don't have the needed adapter). Requires software setup to see full benefits (default FW settings disable motor in over-torque condition). If modding your software, technically lower top speed than HSV. (Standard code speed limit is lower than gold motor limit, so not a disadvantage for regular user).","title":"57AIM30 - Gold Motor"},{"location":"motors/57AIM30/#42aim30-gold-motor-42-variant","text":"In addition to 57AIM30 (Gold Motor), which fits exactly to the previous designs and specs with no extra work, there is a varient motor which has exactly same internals and specs. The 42AIM30 (see notes above for ordering the correct model) does away with the heatsink housing and is purely the cylindrical motor with connectors at the base. Advantages (compared to 57AIM30): Smaller diameter (26%) - plus cylinder vs square. Lighter (unknown - ~25%?) - please submit mass if you have one. Disadvantages (compared to 57AIM30): Much harder to mount. No mounting ears to bolt through, must put exact length machine screws into face of motor.
