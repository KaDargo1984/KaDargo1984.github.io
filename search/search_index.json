A: An OSSM is compact sex machine that can be customized to suit you. It is based around a NEMA23 closed loop servo motor that allows for dynamic changes in speed, depth and position. Q: How much does an OSSM cost? A: That depends. R+D sells a fully assembled, ready-to-play version which varies slightly in price based on exchange rates and material costs. If you source all the components yourself, the OSSM usually comes out to between $300 and $400 USD. Add in a mounting solution and it can approach $500. This is far below the cost of any commercially available fucking machine with similar features. Q: Why go to all this trouble? Why don't you just buy a ready made machine? A: The OSSM is open source, capable and extensible. The parts can be purchased locally and the number of custom parts is kept to a minimum. Best of all you can fully control the stroke speed and most importantly depth. You can make patterns or even your own control software. There is a vibrant and creative community dedicated to building add-ons and using the OSSM in new and interesting ways. Q: What parts do I need? A: TODO Add the BOM Q: I've been reading about motors and now I'm really confused A: If you're confused, the recommended 57AIM30 is probably the right choice for you. Check out the motors for detailed information about the motor choices. Q: I am a size queen and I don't think the IHSV57 or 57AIM30 will be sufficient for my use, what is the upgrade path? A: You're not alone! There is work being done on larger, more powerful hardware implementations. Check out the discord for more information. Q: Hold on, why does anal play need more powerful motors? A: Butts have big powerful muscles! It's common for people to bear down, or clench when things are feeling really good. Also it can be pretty fun shoving big objects in there! It can take a big motor to handle a big toy in a powerful butt. Q: What sized 3D printer do I need? A: The minimum bed size is 105mm x 105mm for the largest single piece. Approximately 125mm of height is required for the shorter vac-u-lock compatible adapter, the plate is significantly shorter. Q: What print material is best? A: All of our testing has been with simple PLA, however if you do print it in an interesting material make sure to share it to the discord! Q: What is the infill percentage? A: 30% has been found to work just fine with PLA for non flexible parts Q: How thick are the walls and top? A: Recommend at least 3mm for non flexible parts. Q: What are these flexible parts and how should I print them? A: There are mounting solutions that use clamps for the OSSM these need some flexibility. For these parts thinner walls 2mm, lower infill percentages and a gyroid pattern. Q: How do I mount toys onto the OSSM? A: The standard OSSM implementation uses a 24mm threaded end effector, a vac-u-lock compatible attachment called the double-bubble can be screwed on, or a flat plate that any dildo can be lashed to can be screwed on. Since the 24mm end effector is standardized, you can put anything you can design on it. Q: What to I mount the machine on? A: Check out Mounting Q: How do I control my OSSM A: It depends on how you are going to use it. Basic OSSM control is via the wired remote and a more advanced remote is available from community members ( M5 Remote ). The control protocols are open source though, so the sky is the limit if you want to develop your own control system. Q: I heard somewhere you can \"control via a web page?\" Can I get people to control my OSSM over the internet? A: As of January 2025 you cannot control an OSSM over the internet. In the past R&D offered a web page that allowed very basic control with speed and depth settings over wifi. Development is in progress to allow this Q: X-Toy and funscript support. Where is it? A: As of January 2025 there is a highly experimental X-toy firmware forked from an earlier version that requires endstops. This code has significant issue and is not considered to be safe for use on humans. There are frequent pauses, it loses track of where it is and has a tendency to randomly extend to maximum depth. Development of an X-Toys firmware is happening but it is complicated. Q: Why is X-Toys/Funscripts/ButtplugIO so difficult? A: Things are a lot more complicated once you dig down into them. The motion core does not yet support position streaming. This is in development and requires a complete redesign of the safety architecture as you don't want to accidentally stab yourself. From the experimental software we learnt that the latency margin is really thin, Bluetooth especially struggles here. This will be a challenge to overcome. The data models of both xtoys and Buttplug.io do not support complex data models as it would be required for OSSM out of the box. As scaling to the full length of OSSM is just not an option. There might be a workaround by emulating an other toy. But you won't be able to control all aspects of OSSM through this. Q: There is an OSSM reference board do I have to buy it to make an OSSM? A: No you don't but it does make building an OSSM a lot easier and stops you having to solder anything. Q: Power supplies what size do I need? A: See the following Document Q: How long should the H-rail be? A: It is really up to you but a 350mm rail will give approximately 195mm of depth. Q: What is the size of the 24mm Thread for the End Effector? A: It is a M24x3 (this is the size on the machine, do a test print for your new End Effector, you may have to upsize by 3-5%)","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#q-what-is-ossm","text":"A: An OSSM is compact sex machine that can be customized to suit you.

This means if you are going to use, modify or contribute to the OSSM project you need to be aware of the risks and potential hazards. After all, an OSSM is poking around in some very intimate and soft places. There are moving belts and motors that have a surprising amount of force all of which can hurt people. Our analysis identifies three areas of hazard; design, build and use which neatly map to groups of people. You may be a member of all three groups or only one, but most people are builders and users. Designers who contribute to the OSSM project or create their own modifications. As a designer you have a role to ensure what you design is safe. This may be a part, code or a pattern. You should also provide guidance to builders and if required users on both hazards and ways to manage them. We recommened you download and review the hazard analysis spreadsheet for more details. Builders are the people that take an OSSM from an idea into a physical reality from components, printed parts and then assemble it into a working machine. As a builder you need to ensure that what you build is strong enough to for use and keep the user safe with the designed controls. Users fall into two subgroups and you can be both at once. Operators and the receptive user who is having all the fun. Good design and a quality build can provide some protection. But keep in mind, a misused OSSM can create hazards that cannot be mitigated by design. Guidance for designers Think about any new hazards that your design may introduce. Some ideas cannot be made safe, but other risks can be managed with careful thought. Inclusive design is often safer design. Designing for people that are visually, physically or cognitively impaired is hard but there are many benefits. FDM/3D printed materials have some qualities you need to be aware of. Layer orientation, material choice all can have a positive (or negative) impact on safety. For safety critical cases be aware of the limitations of software. Programming for safety is harder than it looks and there is a considerable body of knowledge devoted to it. If you can find an alternate hazard mitigation such as a power switch that will be more reliable than a software interrupt. Don\u2019t expect users and builders to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. A designer is often best placed to understand the potential issues. A builder may not identify risks and users are often distracted when using an OSSM. Guidance for builders Get to know your 3D printer and filament. For critical parts print with thicker walls, larger layer heights and hotter temperatures than normal to maximize strength. Resin printers do not typically create strong enough prints to be used safely. Think about finishing and sharp edges. An OSSM is frequently used with minimal clothing and users are often distracted. Try to avoid relying on the user of the OSSM to \"do the right thing\u201d and work around build deficiencies or missing parts such as covers. Guidance for users Understand the risks of using an OSSM. Use appropriate toys. Take frequent breaks. Perform an inspection prior to use. Don\u2019t operate an OSSM with missing or broken parts.

Instructions! Mate the Base Plate with the Motor Attach the OSSM base plate to the motor with (2) 5x20mm cap head screws in the locations marked M5 and tighten with a M5 nut below the motor mounting flange. The nut is usually kept from turning by the motor body. If it spins when tightening, insert a flat head screwdriver between the nut and motor to keep it in place. Build up the Idler Bearings Stack three 5x11x4mm bearings on a 5x20mm cap head bolt and attach to the printed threads in the baseplate, as shown below. They do not need to be tight, just snugged down. the bolts are acting in double sheer, not tension. Install and align the pulley Slide the 20 tooth GT2 pulley onto the shaft of the motor. It should move easily. Align one of the set screws with the flat of the motor and tighten down very gently. Align the pulley as shown below and snug the set screw. Do not tighten it down completely at this time. Install the Liner Rail Be careful not to separate bearing from linear rail, there is a chance of losing ball bearings when the rail and bearing are separated! The image below has the rail removed for clarity, do not remove your rail from the carriage. Install 4 M3x10mm socket cap bolts through the base and into the carriage. Threadlocker such as Loctite 242 is recommended. With the rail now installed, align the toothed portion of the pulley with the rail and tighten down both set screws. Threadlocker such as Loctite 242 is highly recommended. Install Mid Body The mid body is placed on top of the base and attached to the motor with 2 M5x35mm bolts and nuts. The Mid body captures the tops of the bearing bolts and adds the final two bolts to the motor. Alternative Mid body The middle pivot design makes it easier to bolt your ossm directly onto extrusion. It can be mounted using 4x M5x35 screws and 4x M5 nuts as shown below. Here all 4 bolts go through the motor, ossm base, and ossm mid body. Belt Routing Pay special attention to this section. It can be difficult to get the routing and clamping correct. Correct completion of this section is essential to proper OSSM operation. Below is an overview of the final configuration of the belt. - Belt is shown in BLUE - The teeth on the belt are not shown, but should face the pulley. Tensioner The first thing you should do is place the belt into the tensioner. Fold the belt in half with the teeth facing towards each other. Work each end in from the top following the green arrows below. Pull the belt until the lower piece has only a small section sticking out from the tensioner. Then slip the assembly onto the end of the rail. Drop an M5 nut into the slot and thread in an M5x16 bolt into it. Do not tighten the M5 bolt at this point. The result should look like below with the teeth on the top belt facing down Threading the belt into the body Wrapping the belt around the main drive pully and past the stacks of idler pulleys will get the belt in the correct location. The teeth of the belt should mesh with the teeth on the pulley. Fixed belt end The belt routes through the slot in the top belt clamp. Insert the M3x20 screw from the bottom of the rail, through the clamp bottom (with teeth up engaging the belt), and engage the nut in the top clamp. Before you tighten the screw fully, pull the remaining belt slack so it is snug. Tighten the screw to secure the belt. Trim remaining belt (if you are sure you are happy with stroke length!) With the belt now routed, gently move the linear rail back and forth, ensuring the belt tracks on the pulley without rubbing and the system moves smoothly and easily. Tensioning the belt Using the tensioner M5 bolt, increase the tension on the OSSM belt. Tension should only be increased if the system slips under load.

Both are permanent magnet electric motors but steppers are designed for high-precision, low-speed use cases that require strong holding torque. A stepper motor's initial torque is much higher than a servo but drops off significantly as speed increases. A servo will have a much lower continuous torque but will maintain that torque throughout its speed range. Servos are also necessarily closed loop, meaning they will continue to provide torque when stopped and can react to changes in resistance. An open-loop stepper can lose steps and on a system such as the OSSM, this WILL cause a crash.

USB Power Delivery We can all agree that USB-C, USB3.0 and USB-PD are a confusing conglomeration of standards but the benefits have created an exciting new way to power the OSSM. Using a USB-PD initiation device, we can request that a USB-PD capable charger supply 20V at 5A through a properly rated USB-C cable. This can be a wall charger or even a USB power bank. The V3.0 OSSM reference board will include USB-PD onboard, for now an adapter cable or trigger board is needed to enable this feature.","title":"Voltage"},{"location":"design/voltage/#24v-dc-power-supply","text":"The OSSM would not exist without the proliferation of consumer 3D printers.

Pulse (PUL) On the rising edge of the pulse signal (t2 and t6 in the below graphic) from the OSSM board to the motor, the motor advances one step. The default setting for the OSSM is 800 steps per revolution, or 0.45 degrees per step. In the standard design, each rotation of the pulley moves the rail 40mm (20 teeth, 2mm pitch) or 0.05mm per step. In order to move the system at 1m/s, the pulse train approaches 20khz. Direction (DIR) The magic of the OSSM is in the ability to change direction at any point in the motion, meaning depth and stroke length are independently adjustable. When the Direction or DIR pin is pulled high, the motor rotates 1 step in a certain direction each time the PUL pin is pulled high. When the DIR pin is pulled low, the motor rotates 1 step in the opposite direction each time the PUL pin is pulled high. Sensorless Homing Homing using microswitches is fairly simple. The Machine moves in one direction until the limit switch is triggered. It marks this as one end of the rail. The other end can either be detected using a second limit switch or the system can use a fixed rail length in code. Sensorless homing is similar but removes the need for limit switches that can fall out of rig, fail to trigger or trigger prematurely. Sensorless homing is a slight misnomer as the system uses a shunt resistor and current sensor to determine how much power the motor is drawing during the homing sequence. When the system encounters a hard stop, the motor current will suddenly rise very quickly. The firmware captures this event and sets the current position as one end of the rail, much the same as using a limit switch. However unlike a limit switch, the same current sensor can be used to detect the other end of the rail as well. This means that the system is able to home to both ends without the need for any external sensors. There is one downside, however, sensorless homing does require power to flow through the OSSM control board.","title":"Index"},{"location":"electronics/#pulse-and-direction","text":"The OSSM communicates from the control board to the motor using two distinct logic signals, Pulse and Direction.","title":"Pulse and Direction"},{"location":"electronics/#pulse-pul","text":"On the rising edge of the pulse signal (t2 and t6 in the below graphic) from the OSSM board to the motor, the motor advances one step.

For people used to the Arduino IDE, moving to PlatformIO can seem daunting. Trust us that it is simpler than it looks to operate and works far better than the very basic Arduino IDE as the project grows and changes. This is particularly important when it comes to managing all the libraries and dependencies. This gets very complex, very quickly. Earlier builds of OSSM it was sort of possible to mash it into the Arduino IDE and get a compile happening. It has now past the point when it is easier to teach you to use PlatformIO than it is to repackage OSSM for the Arduino at each release. Why? More time for coding features and easier collaboration! OSSM is moving fast. Once you get used to VSCode there are some other great features such automatic downloads from Github and linting (autocomplete for code). Start by installing VSCode and the PlatformIO extension. There are plenty of guides for this on the web. Restart VSCode wait until PlatformIO has started and look on the sidebar for this button. Click \"Open\" This will pop up Click \"Open Project\" and search for the OSSM directory that has platformIO.ini in it In the src directiory you should find main.cpp, click on that Near the bottom of the window look for a tick (compile) and an arrow (upload) You can then compile or skip that step and upload directly to your board. What if that doesn't work? Check the debug screen but chances are you have not selected the right Com port for the OSSM board or the wrong board for the project. COM or /DEV/TTY will vary from machine to machine. It is set here in platformIO The reference board for OSSM has an embedded \"Espressif ESP32 Dev Module\". If the project fails to build and the upload fails DON'T PANIC! Chances are there has been some kind of external library update.
